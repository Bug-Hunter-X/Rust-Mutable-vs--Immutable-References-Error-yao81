This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving mutable and immutable references. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to modify a value through an immutable reference, resulting in a compile-time error. The `bugSolution.rs` file shows how to correctly handle mutable and immutable references to avoid this error.
